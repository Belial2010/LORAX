# LORAX
CVPR Paper - "3D Point Cloud Registration for Localization using a Deep Neural Network Auto-Encoder" 

An RSCS implementation is included.
In addition a fixed-RSCS algorithm is also implemented. It is an augmentation of the original algorithm that allows for better parametric control. Using this you can define exactly how many Super-points should be created, how many points in each Super-point.

The basis code for the Super-point Auto-encoder Feature generator will be included.
